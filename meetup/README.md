# Meetup Application for creating and exploring events.

 Users would create an account and log in, then they could search for events to join or create one.
 After finding an event that would like to join you can by clicking on attend button, and the event would be saved on the calendar.
 If you decided not to join then you can remove it from your calendar easily.
 The calendar is unique for each user.
 
 I create this app from scratch using React, CSS, and Firebase.
